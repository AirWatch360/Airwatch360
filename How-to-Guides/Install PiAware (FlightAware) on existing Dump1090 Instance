# Installing PiAware on an Existing dump1090 Instance

## Overview

If you are running an ADS-B receiver with dump1090 on a Raspberry Pi, you can install the PiAware package to transmit your ADS-B receiver data to FlightAware. This guide will walk you through the steps to install PiAware on your existing dump1090 instance.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm, Bullseye, or Buster)
- Internet connection
- Access to a command line shell on the Pi
- SSH access enabled on the Raspberry Pi

## Steps

### 1. Install the Latest OS Updates and Reboot

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo reboot
```

### 2. Download and Install PiAware

Download and install the FlightAware APT repository package:

```bash
wget https://uk.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/files/packages/pool/piaware/f/flightaware-apt-repository/flightaware-apt-repository_1.2_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i flightaware-apt-repository_1.2_all.deb
```

Update your apt package sources and install PiAware:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install piaware
```

Enable automatic and manual PiAware software updates:

```bash
sudo piaware-config allow-auto-updates yes
sudo piaware-config allow-manual-updates yes
```

### 3. Download and Install dump1090-fa

If you don't already have ADS-B decoder software such as dump1090-fa installed, install it:

```bash
sudo apt install dump1090-fa
```

### 4. (Optional) Download and Install dump978-fa

Note: 978 MHz UAT is only present in the U.S. If you live outside the U.S, you can skip this step.

```bash
sudo apt install dump978-fa
```

### 5. Reboot Your Pi

Reboot your Raspberry Pi to ensure that everything starts correctly:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

### 6. Claim Your PiAware Client on FlightAware.com

Wait about four or five minutes for your PiAware to start, then associate your FlightAware account with your PiAware device:

[Claim your PiAware client on FlightAware.com](https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/claim)

If after 5 minutes your device hasn't displayed as claimed, try restarting the device. If that still doesn't work, re-confirm the Wi-Fi settings (if using Wi-Fi) are correct. Lastly, contact support at ADSBsupport@FlightAware.com.
